## Possible consequences for rules violations ##

- Some policy violations can result in a character being unapproved or retired. These policies will be marked individually. Unapproval means your character, once fixed, may be reapproved. Retirement is permanet and the character may not be played again.

- A warning. We'll tell you what the problem is and how you can improve. If you've already got a warning, or if the offense is egregious and deliberate, we'll skip this step. If you respond violently to the warning, we may move straight to the next step. We're not very patient, so you only get one of these unless there are extraordinary circumstances.

- A ban. Bans are our only real consequence for OOC misbehavior. What are we going to do, make you clean the bathroom? We're not your dad. If it's bad enough that we need to do something worse than a warning, it's bad enough to ban.

We would rather apologize to someone for incorrectly banning them than let a situation involving harassment or abuse continue for even a moment longer. This is a game, not a business, critical infrastructure, or vital service. Affected players can deal with being disconnected for a few hours or days while we figure out what's going on, and if we do cut them off completely, it's not the end of the world.

With that in mind, please follow our policies.

## Player policies ##

All policies, except where otherwise noted, apply to players and staff alike.

### Be kind and if you can't be kind, be respectful ###

This is Rule Zero for this game. If you ignore every other rule in this document, don't ignore this one. If you're the sort of person who finds this kind of rule offensive, this game is not for you.

If something happens and you find you can't keep yourself respectful, step away from the keyboard and consider asking staff to intervene.

### Don't harass people ###

That includes harassing them by misgendering them, using racist invective, repeatedly paging random people of your preferred gender for flirting, and several other actions detailed in other policies.

This is not an exhaustive list. As any kid who's ever said "I'm not touching you!" while waving a finger right above their sibling's skin knows, harassment can be performed in a thousand seemingly innocuous ways.

If someone asks you to stop a behavior, listen to them and do as they ask. Failure to do so, especially deliberately, will not be tolerated here.

Our default position is generally to believe the person who experienced the harassment. We want this game to be a place where harassment isn't tolerated, therefore our response to harassment that reaches the level of requiring staff intervention is generally swift and final.

If you're being harassed, whether on game or off, log everything (or take screenshots, if it's Discord or the like) and talk to staff. We can handle the "player has requested that you no longer contact them" conversation for you if you're not OK with doing it yourself, and we will be happy to escort them to the door if they refuse.

If you'd rather not involve staff, that's OK too, but please consider letting us know, since when a player harasses one person, they're likely harassing others, and we can't do anything about it if we don't know.

### Keep your RP and character in theme ###

This is its own mad-science Victorian supernatural ghost-filled setting, and it's awesome. Play along!

Characters that don't fit within the setting may be retired or unapproved.

### No player characters under 18 ###

It opens up a lot of power imbalance and creeptastic RP. We aren't up for arbitrating that.

Characters found to be violating this rule will be retired or unapproved.

### Follow the game rules ###

This game is rules-based with room for player-to-player negotiation. If there's a breakdown in communication, rules trump negotiation. Staff have the final say.

If you need help with the rules, we have a Rules channel you're welcome to ask questions on.

See our Book List and House Rules documents for a full list of the rules.

Players who fail to follow the game rules may find their characters retired or unapproved.

### Keep the game fun for yourself and others ###

The goal of this game is to foster cooperative, entertaining RP. PVP is possible, but death is not the end, and even conflict can bring about exciting roleplay. Work towards one another's enjoyment, not against it.

Characters that ruin enjoyment of the game for others may be retired or unapproved.

### Fade to black when necessary ###

FTB is a tool. If the RP is getting boring, if you don't feel like it, if you're uncomfortable for any reason, fade to black. This can also help you get some emotional distance from what's being played out.

If you're comfortable with it, you can let the other players know if something about the RP bothered you, but you *absolutely* do not need to say anything aside from "Let's FTB here."

If someone FTBs in a scene you're in, respect their request, work out what happens in the scene in broad strokes rather than fine details, and do *not* push them to play it out anyway or try to punish them for fading. Treat it as a request for space and honor it.

Failing to honor a FTB request is harassment.

### Use content warnings ###

Certain topics require advance warning before they come up, and can be rejected as topics for RP or conversation by all players involved.

These topics are off limits on public channels, +bboards, and other places where the reader may not have a choice before engaging with them.

- What topics? Including but not limited to: violence against children and pets, domestic violence, sexual violence, eating disorders, dysphoria, transphobia, homophobia, racism, self-harm, and suicide. These are topics that can provoke PTSD responses in players who are unprepared for them.

- When: **Before** these topics come up in RP, in logs, or in discussion. RP and conversation must pause until OKs are given by all. If a new player arrives, warnings must be re-given and OKs must be re-acquired before RP or conversation can resume.

- Who should you warn? Anyone you're playing with or talking to about these topics, unless you have had a talk about it and they've already said that they don't need or want content warnings.

- How: `<OOC> I plan to bring up <topics>. Is everyone OK with that?` If anyone says no, avert your RP. Your warning must be clear, but not detailed - say "domestic violence" or "dysphoria" rather than giving an explicit description of the act.

  - Logs must be tagged with any appropriate content warnings in the head of the log. Reading further counts as acceptance.

  - Events must be tagged with expected content warnings and those warnings must also be given at the beginning of play.

Repeated failure to use content warnings is a form of harassment.

### De-escalate where possible ###

Don't go into any situation looking for reasons to get angry. If you're feeling upset, consider going AFK for a short break.

If you've got a problem with another player, remember Rule Zero and consider talking to them about it. If you don't feel safe doing that, or if you try and they aren't listening to you, please bring staff into it. We're here to help.

If you've got a problem with staff, consider finding another game. We're tiny and we have to approve your stuff, you're not going to be able to avoid us.

### Don't mess with other people's stuff without permission ###

Shared resources, like community NPCs, public buildings, the code, the general wiki, etc, require staff's permission to alter. Other people's characters, equipment, buildings, and wiki pages are off limits without their OOC permission or staff's.

**Be aware that joining a score counts as consent for other players to modify your character.** If you'd like to avoid modifications like loot, XP, injuries, etc, don't join scores. You might not avoid all modification - PVP is possible on this game - but you will reduce it.

**This rule doesn't apply to staff, unlike all the others.** We can mess with your stuff with impunity (but will try to alert you if we do). See the [Be careful when modifying people's stuff](#be-careful-when-modifying-peoples-stuff) staff policy for the rules for staff.

### Abandoned stuff is fair game ###

If you log off and stay off long enough to get idle-retired, your buildings, crew, etc, may be destroyed or passed to someone else and modified beyond recognition. If you would rather avoid this, put in a `+job` before you quit detailing what you want done with or to your holdings, and stick around long enough to make sure it's resolved.

## Staff policies ##

Staff are required to abide by these, in addition to the other policies (except where noted).

### Be realistic about your time and stamina ###

Be willing to say no to requests that will take up a lot of time or require substantial amounts of work you're not up for. Let the player know up front and either reject it outright or (less preferred) stick it on the back burner. Try not to let +jobs fill up with stuff you're not going to get back to.

### Regularly purge old jobs ###

If it's a month old and you're not going to do it and I'm not going to do it and the player's not going to do it, it gets tossed. Wrench hates old jobs.

### Say yes when it doesn't hurt anything ###

In fact, say yes a lot, and be encouraging when you do. Small things like a bit of XP or a new piece of by-the-book gear should be almost automatically OKed. Custom gear might require a bit of back-and-forth, but standard gear from the book? Go for it.

Character approval should be almost automatic - if it passes the tests and the desc is acceptable (i.e. not underage), the only reason to deny it might be if it's unthemely, and our theme allows a lot of leeway. If you're not sure or have serious doubts, run it past another staffer.

### Address problems in the forum in which they arise ###

Board post problem requires a board post response. Public channel problem requires a public channel reply. Private messages? Stick to private messages between you and the people involved, don't take it public.

If someone posts something that violates the content warning policy or something that's in other ways likely to hurt people, take it down and put something up in its place, then immediately take the player aside.

The sole exception to this rule are bans - the playerbase generally needs to know when someone gets banned, though the reason for their departure need not be aired for everyone to see unless a substantial number of people are affected by it. Bans should always be announced.

### Be careful when modifying people's stuff ###

In general, don't modify people's characters without consent. If you can't get consent and the issue is an immediate problem, make the change and notify them about it via `+job/query <player>=<notification>`.

Don't allow players to join an existing crew without the permission of all reachable members of the crew.

If a character needs major modification, unapprove them, make the changes, and get the player's OK before reapproving them so that you can be sure that they actually want to play this version of their character. They may want to make other changes if their old build no longer works as advertised.

### Retire or unapprove characters ###

Retiring or unapproving characters is not a punishment. It's a way of enforcing the kind of RP and IC behavior we want to see. If a player is disruptive in ways that aren't tied to their character, see [Warnings and bans](#warnings-and-bans).

Characters may be retired or unapproved in the situations listed here. This is not an exhaustive list.

#### Failing to obey the game rules ####

This means trying to come up with loopholes or actively lying or cheating, not just garden-variety failure to understand the rules.

#### Playing a character who is under 18 ####

If we approved the character, it wasn't younger than 18. If it gets changed after the approval, or somehow the age slipped past us, the character must be unapproved until the age is fixed.

#### Playing their character in an unthemely way ####

This is for characters that take the names of real people, characters that are ported over from other settings which don't fit with ours, or characters which are outright not possible within the setting. Look for things that defy suspension of disbelief.

#### Making the game un-fun for others ####

This is a catch-all for player behavior that causes problems but doesn't quite rise to the level of harassment. Examples might be OOCly refusing to negotiate in a PVP situation, creating a character solely to attack others, or creating characters specifically to disrupt events.

Be aware that the player may be violating Rule Zero, and a warning or ban should be considered. Character unapproval or retirement are only for mild, non-toxic cases.

### Resolve OOC conflicts OOCly ###

Don't allow one player to harass another via the game rules. If a conflict is purely IC, staff will rarely need to be involved. Most conflicts that involve staff have either started OOC or become OOC, and should be handled there first.

### Handling PVP ###

This is a non-consensual game, and as such, players may want to attack one another's holdings, characters, etc, without the other player being OK with that. They may ask staff to arbitrate it if they're worried about the other player refusing to participate. Address such requests on a case by case basis.

1. Make sure you know why you're being asked to intervene and handle it OOC instead of IC if it's an OOC issue.

2. The targeted player(s) must be involved where possible. They don't need to consent, but they do need to communicate with you if they want to keep playing. Refusal to participate is not escape from consequences; if all else fails, they can FTB, but they still need to work it out with you. If they completely fail to do so, unapprove or retire their character.

3. Any OOC must be kept respectful.

4. The game's rules, particularly the Resolving PVP house rules, must be followed.

5. Attacking someone can have consequences for the attackers, not just the victim. Make sure to apply both sets of consequences where applicable.

### Warnings and bans ###

Some people are going to break the rules, either by accident or on purpose. They may be having life problems, bad days, or just didn't read the rules well enough to understand them. This is normal and expected. If it rises to the level of an actionable problem, we need to handle it directly and clearly.

Here's the process:

1. Log everything so you can answer questions about it later.

2. If the problem is immediate and ongoing, ban immediately. `+ban <name>=<reason>` is the command. This is most necessary in cases of harassment, abuse, and hacking. You can `+unban <player>` if you find out the situation is not as it appears. When a player is banned, they are shown the game's contact email address as a way to appeal, along with the reason for the ban.

3. Check for existing warnings on them **and their alts**. If you find an existing warning, ban the person. There's a little wiggle room here and you can choose *not* to ban them if you judge it appropriate. If you don't ban them, proceed to the next step.

4. Warn the player officially and log the warning. Use the sample warning template or something similar in a `+job/query <name>=<warning>`. When you're done, `+staffnote <name>/Warning=<what they did, your warning, and how they responded to it>`.

5. See how they handle the warning. If their response is more rule-breaking (remember Rule Zero - if they get disrespectful, it's a rules violation), ban them immediately.

#### Sample warning ####

```text
Hey <name>, it's been brought to our attention that you aren't following the rules. Specifically, we're concerned about:

- Concern A, be specific
- Concern B, be specific

Our rules state that <short version of the rules they've violated>. You can read the full text at <link to the rules on the wiki>.

This is an official warning. An official warning is noted on your character and, if the same behavior is encountered again, it can lead to you being banned from the game.

You can improve your behavior by <insert steps here>. We'd love to see improvement and we're happy to help you in any way we can with getting better about this.

If you have any questions, or if there's anything we can do to make improvement easier for you, please reach out to us via this +job. If we don't hear back from you, we'll close this job within a few days.
```

A good warning includes:

1. Specific details about what they did wrong.
2. A reference to the rule they violated and any other relevant rules.
3. Confirmation that yep, this is official.
4. Specific suggestions for how they can improve.
5. The consequences they'll experience if they fail to improve.
6. Whether and when we expect a response.

#### Other kinds of warnings ####

If you find that a behavior is not particularly egregious but you want to have a talk with the player about it, document that with `+staffnote <player>/Staff talk: <topic>=<a summary of the talk you had and their response>`. A talk about something isn't quite the same as a warning, but if it turns out that you did have a talk with someone *and they ignored it*, that's worth knowing.

If someone needs multiple staff talks, or explicitly ignores them, that can be a sign of an unacceptable pattern of behavior, and the only way we have of knowing about it for sure is if it's documented. Make sure to note it on their character.
