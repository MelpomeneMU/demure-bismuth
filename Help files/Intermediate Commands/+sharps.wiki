|detail=Sharps are a point system that rewards OOC good behavior, game stewardship, and acting in a way that makes the game fun for everyone. They can be awarded by staff for things like:

* GMing
* In celebration of a holiday
* Anything that makes the game better (useful builds, bug-finding, etc)

They can also be acquired by roleplaying with other players and getting +nominated.

Sharps can be spent:
* To buy badges
* To buy advanced playbooks at character creation
* Any other rewards staff deems acceptable
