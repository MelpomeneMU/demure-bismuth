|detail=The IC time is in no way matched to the OOC time - Doskvol operates on a strange calendar. See [[News:Doskvol_Time|Doskvol Time]] for details! The +time command is to be used as a suggestion, not a fact, and is there to provide fuel for roleplay.
|example=
* '''+time''' and '''+weather''' - view the time and weather.
* '''+time/holidays <month>''' - see the holidays in each month.
* '''+time/season''' - see the seasons.
* '''+time/hours''' - see the hours. (Spammy!)
* '''+time/days''' - see the days.
