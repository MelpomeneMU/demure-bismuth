* '''+health''' - see your injuries and healing clock.
* '''+harm <level> <reason>''' - hurt yourself. If you skip <level>, the game will assume a 1L harm. Level 4 harm is usually fatal, and you will see a warning before you take your last level of harm. If it gets that far, a job will be opened automatically with staff to discuss your character's afterlife.
* '''+dt/recover <#>''' - spend a point of downtime to roll a recovery - the amount of dice you'll roll will vary with the situation.
* '''+harm/clear <player>''' (staff-only) - clear a player's harm completely. Useful when moving them on to a new playbook, like Ghost...
