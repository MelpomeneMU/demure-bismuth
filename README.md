# demure-bismuth

This requires byzantine-opal installed.

Goal: A working MUX for Blades in the Dark (<https://bladesinthedark.com/greetings-scoundrel>).

This code is alpha stage. It has not been tested extensively by anyone but the maintainer. It is expected to change frequently and be cleaned up regularly. Don't use it unless you're comfortable with that. I will not support it - I'm still writing it!

Suggestions/questions welcome - deliver to bladesinthemux@gmail.com.
